1) This version is not yet complete.

2) It has known bugs and is lacking
   features.

3) It is also only a single stand-alone
   version at present.

4) Future plans are to make it playable
   across a network.

5) The domain chess36.com has been
   reserved for this purpose.

6) When I have time, I will address
   these issues.

7) I welcome contributions to the project.

8) Thank you, and may The Lord Jesus Christ
   bless your work and mine unto Himself.
   Amen.
